## Introduction
This is the current project I am working on. The project aims to use machine learning model to predict maize's quantitative traits, find heterosis and traits related SNPs. We have collected over 30,000 samples SNP data and traits data.

## Methods
We have tried many machine learning models which have many problems. Then we use two new models Mixed-Ridge and Metric-Regressor to try to solve the problem. We also try some more to try to solve the problem.
